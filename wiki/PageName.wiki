== What can we do ==

== What can we do ==
This app proposes a demo, showing that we can read some private data from an android device, then send them out by network, without claiming any permission in AndroidManifest.xml

It's a common sense that we can read the privacy from external storage without claiming [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE] permission now, this app shows how to send them out secretly by networks, without claiming [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#INTERNET INTERNET] permission.

== Which device will be impacted ==
This exploit works on the latest android 4.3, I think it works on all android releases too. ALL devices will be impacted.

== Which privacy will be impacted ==
All data in external storage, including
   * All photos, movies, documents
   * All private data generated by other apps, such as
     # Apps and their data by [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup Titanium Backup] (10,000,000+ installs)
     # Texts by [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore SMS Backup & Restore] (1,000,000+ installs)
     # Contacts by [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.idea.backup.smscontacts Super Backup : SMS & Contacts] (1,000,000+ installs)
     # Files downloaded by browser

== When will android do something about this ==
The Android Security Team said that all operations in this exploit were "not a vulnerability" and "working as intended", so malwares could keep stealing the private data for a long time.

== How to deploy this exploit into an app ==
Use the MainActivity as a splash activity.

== Can anyone notice the stealing procedure? ==
I don't think so.

== What can we do on our own? ==
   * Turn on "Protect SD Card" in "Developer options" (Android 4.1+)
   * Keep an eye on the permission [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW]
   * Pray
